**Overview**
This project aims to analyze a [Netflix dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data), which includes details about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. 

`About this Dataset`: Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

The project involves :
* **Data wrangling** : cleaning the data
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Time series analysis**
* **Clustering** : to identify patterns and group similar content

By the end of the project, I will present insights into Netflixâ€™s content, uncovering key trends and relationships within the data.

**Files included**
* `netflix_titles.csv` : The original dataset containing details about Netflix movies and TV shows.
* `Netflix_project.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook with the project
